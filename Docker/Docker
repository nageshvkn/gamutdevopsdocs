		Docker - The Container Virtualization Tool
	==================================================
Day-1:
######
#
Diff between..
- Physical server
- Virtual machine
- Docker container.

VM, Docker, usage in realtime

#
what is docker? why docker? who can use it?


#
Supported Platforms-
	- Docker is supported on
		- Linux platforms
			Ubuntu, RHEL, CentOs..etc.
		- Windows  
		- OS X 		
		  
	- Cloud Platforms
		Amazon EC2
		Rackspace Cloud
		Google compute Engine..etc.
		Azure

Note:
Linux containers can be created on Windows and OS X.
HOW?- Windows Docker installer contains a tiny Linux virtual machine. Docker creates linux container on top of this tiny Linux VM.


Requirements:
	- 64-bit architecture	  
	- Linux 3.8 or later Kernel versions


#
Requirements Check:
- Check Kernel version
	$ uname -a Or -r

NOTE: Kernel can also be upgraded.

- Check OS name:
	$ lsb_release -a / -cs
	$ cat /etc/os-release	


Installation Steps:
=====================	
# Update apt-get cache
	$ sudo apt-get update

# Install docker dependencies
	$ sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common

# Add GPG key to apt repository
	$ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

# Setup Stable repository (Add docker download URL manually to apt cache):
	$ sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
	
# Update apt package index:
	$ sudo apt-get update
	
# Install Latest version of Docker
	$ sudo apt-get install docker-ce

#
Installation Check
sudo docker --version

#
uninstall docker:
$ sudo apt-get remove docker-ce


DAY-2
#
Managing docker containers
===============================
#
"docker run" command
- "docker run" command provides all lanuching capabilities for docker to create a container.
- we use `docker run` to create new containers.


# Creating first container

sudo docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash

	-i : opens STDIN from the container
	-t : tells docker to assign a pseudo-tty to the
		 container.
	-it : provides interactive shell
	
	`ubuntu`: is an image and also called as "stock image" or "base image".
			  This will be downloaded by default from 'Docker hub' for the first
			  time.
	
	/bin/bash: shell that will be installed in the terminal.



# Inspect the new container
1.
	hostname
2.
	cat /etc/hosts
3.
	apt-get update
	apt-get install net-tools
4.
	ifconfig
		observe etho and lo network interfaces with 
		ip address
5.
	ps -ef


# SSH setup for containers
Setup SSH in the containers so that they can communicate to each other

- Create two containers
		172.17.0.2
		172.17.0.3
- Try to connect to 172.17.0.3 from 172.17.0.2 using below command. You will get an error
	$ ssh gamut@172.17.0.3

- Install ssh server
$ apt-get update
$ apt-get install openssh-server

- Start the server
$ service ssh start (status/stop)


- Create an user and set up password
$ useradd -m -d /home/gamut -s /bin/bash gamut
$ passwd gamut
	
- Connect to the container using ssh from your host or any other container.
$ ssh gamut@172.17.0.3


#
Shotdown a container
"exit" to stop the container

# List all containers(stopped and running)
sudo docker ps -a

# List running containers only
docker ps

# ps command output shows
	- Image name from which container is created
	- ID - container can be identified using short UUID, longer UUID Or name.
	- Status of the container (Up / Exited)
	- Name


# See longer UUID of the container 
	$ docker ps -a --no-trunc -q"

# show the last container which you have created(stopped/running)
sudo docker ps -l

# Naming the container
	docker run --name gamut -it ubuntu /bin/bash

Note: Two containers can't have the same name.

# Rename a container
$ docker rename db-server3 db-server-name3

# Deleting a container
$ docker rm ID/name

#
docker info

# Delete all containers at once.
 $ docker rm `docker ps -a -q`
 $ docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)


# Starting a stopped container
	sudo docker start gamut
	sudo docker stop aa3f365f0fdocker4e
	sudo docker restart gamut

# Shortcut Keys
	Ctrl + p + q - push a running container in background mode.
	Ctrl + d -  short cut to 'exit' from the container.
	

# Attaching to a running container
	docker attach gamut
	docker attach b1b1c8dc1939



# List Stopped containers only
$ docker ps -a -f status=exited ( Where Status can be exited/running )


DAY-3:
	# Inspecting the container's processes from host machine
	- docker top <container-name>

# Stoping a container from 'host machine'
	- docker stop dgamut
	- docker stop ee319cddd42e(Gracefully stop the cntainer with SIGTERM)
	- docker kill dgamut (Forcibly stop the container with SIGKILL)

# Show last 4 containers (stopped/running)
	- docker ps -n4


# Find More About The Container
- docker inspect comamnd "interrogates" the container and returns the info like.. configuration info, names, commands, n/w configurations, stopped/running ..etc.
	 
	 Examples:
	$ docker inspect <container-name>

	$ docker inspect --format '{{.Config.Hostname}}' dgamut

	$ docker inspect -f '{{.NetworkSettings.Networks.bridge.IPAddress}}' db-server1

	$ docker inspect --format {{.NetworkSettings.Networks.bridge.IPAddress}} 
	 `docker ps -q`
	
 Note: use --format (OR) -f  	


- Remove all running containers
		docker rm -f `docker ps -q`

#
$ docker pause db-server1
$ docker unpause db-server1


DAY-4:
# Docker Images
=================
Agenda:
	- Understand docker Image
	- Create docker Image
	- Store docker Image
	- Share your own Image
	- Examine repositories that hold images

- Docker images are the building blocks for creating container.
- From images, we launch containers.
	
# Listing docker images
		- docker image ls

- Images live in '/var/lib/docker/image/overlay2/imagedb/content/sha256'
- Containers live in '/var/lib/docker/containers'


# Images in Build and Deployments OR DevOps world!

a. Works In my machine problem.
b. Developers can set local env.
c. Issue? don't troubleshoot. Just throw it away and create new instantly.
d. Auto scale your environment
e. No need to live with complex, redundant configurations.
f. You can leverage/utilize local machines's computing power when you need to test your code on multiple machines, instead of waiting for DevOps team to supply or wasting extra computing power. you already have 500GB, 16GB RAM right? are you utilising it? NO! then whey again you need extra hardware?


DAY-5:
PROJECT-1:
============
#
SETTING-UP NGINX SERVER ON UBUNTU MANUALLY:
--------------------------------------------
 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get install -y nginx

 start/stop/restart nginx server:
=========== 			
 sudo service nginx start
 			  nginx stop 
			  nginx restart
			  nginx status

Web content/Deployment path: /var/www/html

Uninstall nginx:
sudo apt-get purge nginx nginx-common


# Building our own Image
	We have 2 Ways to create docker image:
		1. docker "commit"
		2. docker "build" cmd & Dockerfile

# Creating docker image using "docker commit" command

PROJECT-1:
	Create an image which will ship your application code along with nginx configuration.

-create container
	$ docker run -it --name school-app-base-cont ubuntu /bin/bash
	
- Install nginx manually
	$ apt-get update
	$ apt-get install -y nginx

- Deploy some application code into /var/www/html
	sample index.html:
=======
		<html>
   			<body>
     			<h1 style="color:red;">Gamutkart Online Training Portal</h1>
				</body> 
		</html>
=======

- Create a docker image from the container (OR) Convert docker container as 	 
  docker image
	$ docker commit school-app-base-cont nageshvkn/nginx-img
	
- Check if image has been created
	$ docker images

- Push the newly created image to docker hub
	$ docker login
	$ docker push nageshvkn/nginx-img

Note: Now you have succussfully containerized your application and published the iamge to DockerHub

Note: To verify your image, create a container as your customer

- Customers can spin millions of new containers using below command and all get application with nginx out-of-box.
	$ docker run -it nageshvkn/nginx-img /bin/bash


PROJECT-2:
=============
DAY-6:
# Creating docker image using "docker build" command
=================
	- mkdir gamutgurus
	- cd gamutgurus
	- touch Dockerfile

	--> 'gamutgurus' directory is called "context" or "build context".
		It contains the code, files or other data that you want to include in the image.
	
	- Write Dokckerfile:
		FROM ubuntu:16.04
		MAINTAINER "info@gamutgurus.com"
		RUN apt-get update
		RUN apt-get install -y nginx
		COPY index.html /var/www/html
		ENTRYPOINT service nginx start && bash

index.html:
=======
<html>
   <body style="background-color:powderblue;">
     <h1 style="color:red;">Gamug Gurus Online Training Portal</h1>
	</body> 
</html>
 	
# Building docker image:
	$ cd gamutgurus
	$ docker build -t="nageshvkn/nginx-img" .
	$ docker build -f MyDockerfile -t="nageshvkn/nginx-img" . [If Dockerfile name
																	is different]

# Listing docker image
$ docker images

# Pushing custom images to docker repository
	$ docker login
	$ docker push nageshvkn/nginx-image

#
Testing Image

# Remove the local image so that it will be downloaded from Docker Hub.
	$ docker rmi nageshvkn/nginx-image
 
# Creating a new container from our image
	$ docker run -it --name nginx-container nageshvkn/nginx-img /bin/bash

# Verify if nginx is running from the container.
	$ http://172.17.0.2:80


# Creating docker hub account
- Docker Hub (https://hub.docker.com/)
	- Each Repository can contain multiple images
	- Images are Identified using tags.

	
#
User Images Syntax:
	nageshvkn/nginx (username/imagename)

Official Images Syntax:
	ubuntu

User images are controled by Docker users.
official images are controled by Docker core team.


# Specifying Image via tags
	- ubuntu:16.04
	  ubuntu- is image name
	  16.04 - is called tag


# Pulling the images
	- docker pull tomcat

# Searching docker images in docker hub
	- docker search puppet
	- docker search jenkins


# Deleting an Image
	- docker rmi gamut/nginx

# Deleting all Images
	- docker rmi `docker images -q`


DAY-7:
#
Docker Image layers
=========================
- Checking the history of our docker image
	$ docker history <Image-Id>

# Build image without using build cache	
	- Use --no-cache option
	$ docker build --no-cache -t="username/imagename" .


# Container creation process - Deep dive
  How contaner is created:
		
		Writable Layer		
		-		
		Gamutkart application		
		Apache image
		nginx image
		-		
		Ubuntu Base Image(rootfs)
		-
		Bootfs:
		    cgroups, namespace, divicemapper/aufs..etc.
		Kernel


DAY-8:
Gamutkart Real application;
============================
Agenda:
- Build and deployments with Docker containers.
- Real Containerization with Docker.
- Creating dockerized environments.
- Dockerizing your application.

Question:
How are you using docker containerization tool for your builds and deployments?
Can you explain your Docker environment?
Can you explain how you have implemented Docker in your project?
Given a chance how do you dockerize your application?


1. Clone the source code from Git or any other V.C.S
	$ git clone https://github.com/nageshvkn/gamutkart2.git
 
2. Build the code using your favourate build tool Maven/ANT
	$ mvn install

3. Create docker image for the application(gamutkart2) with
   war file, tomcat,jdk...etc using below Dockerfile.
	Dockerfile:
	-------------
	FROM tomcat:8.0
	COPY gamutkart.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps
	ENTRYPOINT /usr/local/tomcat/bin/startup.sh && bash

4. Build the Image using below command
	$ docker build -t "nageshvkn/gamutkart-img" .

5. Run below shell script to create an environment with give no. containers
	$ ./create-env.sh 10

6. Observer all containers created using above script ($ docker ps)

7. Launch the gamutkart application from all containers.
	$ http://IP:8080/gamutkart

#
Docker and Jenkins Integration


Notes:
======
#
Docker Benefits:
=================
1. Portability: 
	ship environments from one type of infrastructure to another without building up new VMs and tearing down the old ones.

2. Quick deployment/Teardown:
	With a single command, you can spin up new containers or tear down existing ones. If you want to clone a new VM, you are looking at waiting for close to or over a few hours. With Docker, it will take a few minutes to achieve what you need.

3. Consistency:
	No more of the "works on my machine!" excuse. As
everyone uses the same images to work, consistency is always guaranteed.
	All the container will act the same in your environment as it will on others.

4. Managing infrastructure-like code:
When it comes to upgrades, you can simply update your Dockerfile, and then tear down the old one. This helps not only with updates, but it can also help with rollbacks as well.

# 
Manage/Run Docker as a non-root user
==========================
Run docker command without sudo.	
------
	1. Create the "docker" group
		$ sudo groupadd docker

	2. Add your user to this group
		$ sudo usermod -aG docker gamut

	3. Logout and Login back so that your group membership
	   is re-evaluated.

-- verification and cleanup

	4. Check group existance:
		$ sudo grep docker /etc/group

	5. Delete the group
		$ sudo groupdel docker
	
	6. You can use 'gpasswd' command to remove the user from the group or add the 
	   User to the group.
		$ sudo gpasswd -d gamut docker
		$ sudo gpasswd -a gamut docker

Misc:
=======
# How to set Environment variable in a container?
ENV JAVA_HOME /home/gamut/Distros/jdk1.8.0_151

# How to you log into a container automatically using a particular user
	Add below docker instruction
		USER gamut

# How do you cd to a particular directory automatically once the container is created?
	WORKDIR /home/gamut

# How do you pass arguments to the container during "docker run" command?
	CMD ["/usr/sbin/useradd", "-m", "-d", "/home/gamut", "-s", "/bin/bash", "gamut"]


Misc:
====
--> docker volumes
--> port mapping
--> docker smarm
